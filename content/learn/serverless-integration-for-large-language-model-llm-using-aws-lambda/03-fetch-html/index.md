title: '3 - Fetch HTML with an URL'
description: "Building a service for fetching HTML."
summary: "Use Python packages, requests and BeautifulSoup4, to parse HTML into plain text."
tags: ["Requests", "BeautifulSoup4"]
---

## Overview

Fetch HTML content using an URL and then extract the content as plain text.

## Get plain text from an URL

First add the `beautifulsoup4` package to the prject.

```bash
pipenv install beautifulsoup4
```

Then create a new file `web_scraper.py`, and add following code to it.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def get_text_from_url(url: str) -> str:
    """
    Fetches the HTML from a URL and returns the plain text content.
    
    Args:
        url: The URL to fetch.
    
    Returns:
        The plain text content of the webpage.
    
    Raises:
        requests.exceptions.RequestException: If an HTTP request error occurs.
    """
    try:
        # Fetch the HTML content
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes
        
        # Parse the HTML and extract text
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        return soup.get_text(separator='\n', strip=True)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error fetching URL {url}: {e}")
        return ""

# Example of how to use the reusable function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    url_to_scrape = 'https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models'
    text_content = get_text_from_url(url_to_scrape)
    if text_content:
        print(text_content)
```

Run following command in terminal to test.

```
pipenv run python src/web_scraper.py
```

The output should be something like the following.

## Make it reusable

We need this function in the Lambda handler too.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

class WebScraper:
    """
    A reusable class for fetching and parsing web content.
    """
    def __init__(self, parser='html.parser'):
        """Initializes the scraper with a specific HTML parser."""
        self.parser = parser
        self.session = requests.Session()

    def get_html(self, url: str) -> str:
        """Fetches the raw HTML content from a URL."""
        try:
            response = self.session.get(url)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.text
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Error fetching URL {url}: {e}")
            return ""

    def parse_text(self, html_content: str) -> str:
        """Parses HTML content and extracts the plain text."""
        if not html_content:
            return ""
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, self.parser)
        return soup.get_text(separator='\n', strip=True)

    def scrape_plain_text(self, url: str) -> str:
        """Fetches a URL and returns the plain text content."""
        html_content = self.get_html(url)
        return self.parse_text(html_content)
```

We need some code to test and verify this class works. Please add the following code to the end of the `web_scraper.py`.

```python
# The following code runs only if you execute web_scraper.py directly
# So that this file can be imported into other Python files without
# triggering the execution of this block of code.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    scraper = WebScraper()
    url_to_scrape = 'https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models'
    
    # Use the combined method
    text_content = scraper.scrape_plain_text(url_to_scrape)
    if text_content:
        print("--- Plain text content ---")
        print(text_content)
```

Run following command in terminal to test. (Same as above)

```
pipenv run python src/web_scraper.py
```

You should see the same result as previously.

## Congratulations !! :tada:
